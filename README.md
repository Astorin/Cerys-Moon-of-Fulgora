# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a mysterious moon of Fulgora whose ancient secrets lie frozen below a thick layer of dry ice.

A gentle solar wind drifts overhead under Fulgora's magnetic influence. As you touch down, methane ice scatters into the airless atmosphere. Asteroids wander overhead.

You glimpse frozen structures lodged throughout the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they found another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay: Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice, repair them in a variety of different ways, defrost your factory using a new mechanic, and more.
- Traditional mining is combined with a novel recycling chain based on nuclear plant components. Iron is a scarce resource (despite several methods to obtain it), providing new challenges in the early-game.
- Unlike planets, the play area is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pods cannot drop resources onto Cerys (without researching a specific technology.)
- Ultimately, the moon is a set of puzzles and secrets that long-time Factorio players will enjoy.

There are no changes to vanilla content, so it is simple to include this mod in existing saves.

## Notes

- Rewards to the rest of the game are venting and flaring towers, plus plutonium rocket fuel, ammo and portable reactor. These rewards are intentionally modest, as Cerys is largely a self-contained experience.
  - The mod contains a 2.0 port of [GotLag's Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flare%20Stack) of higher quality than those we could find. This is planned to be extracted into a separate mod.
- We didn't originally set out to make a full 'planet'. This mod spun out of thesixthroc's explorations in revamping Fulgora for [Space Age: Hardcore Mode](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Space-Age-Hardcore-Mode).
- We enjoy talking to players, so please feel free to reach out on Discord. thesixthroc has an interest in professional game design, so feel free to contact him for that.
- If you can't heat anything, take the iron stick out.
