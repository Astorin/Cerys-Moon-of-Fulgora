# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a moon of Fulgora whose ruins lie frozen under a thick layer of dry ice. As you touch down, methane ice crystals scatter into the airless atmosphere. Asteroids wander overhead, anlomg with a gentle solar wind under Fulgora’s magnetic influence.

You glimpse many frozen structures lodged in the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they turned to another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay:
    - Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice.
    - Repair machine ruins by various methods.
    - Defrost your factory with a new mechanic, different to Aquilo.
    - Solve the workings of plutonium.
    - Unlike planets, the play area is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge.
- Traditional mining is combined with a novel recycling chain based on nuclear components. Iron is a scarce resource, providing challenge in the early-game. Logistic bots appear only later in the gameplay.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pods cannot drop resources onto Cerys (without researching a specific technology.)
- It is simple to include Cerys in existing saves as there are zero changes to vanilla: no restrictions on vanilla planets, changes to vanilla gameplay, or new recipes with purely vanilla items.
- On first playthrough, Cerys is equal parts puzzle game and Space Age planet.

## Notes

- Rewards to the rest of the game are intentionally modest: venting and flaring towers, plutonium rocket fuel, plutonium portable reactor (made obsolete by Aquilo), plutonium ammo, and an infinite productivity technology.
  - This is for easy gameplay compatibility with existing saves. Cerys is a largely self-contained experience.
- Cerys contains a 2.0 port of GotLag’s [Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flare%20Stack) of higher quality than we could find. This is planned to be extracted into a separate mod.
- We didn't originally set out to make a 'planet'. This mod grew out of roc experimenting with nuclear plant recycling chains after the release of [Hardcore Fulgora](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Rocs-Hardcore-Fulgora).
