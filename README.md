# Cerys

You discover Cerys, a mysterious moon of Fulgora whose ancient secrets lie frozen below a thick layer of dry ice. A gentle solar wind drifts above under Fulgora's magnetic influence. As you touch down, methane ice scatters into the airless atmosphere. Asteroids wander overhead.

You glimpse frozen structures lodged throughout the surface. Though made of new materials, they bear the hallmarks of the Fulgorans. As you explore, it becomes apparent that without lightning, they found another source of power.

## Features

- Brand new gameplay:
  - Uncover ancient wrecks from multiple layers of ice.
  - Repair the Fulgoran wrecks by various methods.
  - Defrost your factory with a new mechanic, unlike Aquilo.
  - Solve the mysteries of plutonium.
  - Unlike planets, the play area is finite. Terrain curves as you approach the moon's edge.
- Traditional mining is combined with a novel recycling chain based on nuclear components. Iron is a scarce resource (despite several methods to obtain it), providing challenge in the early-game.
- It is said that due to the solar wind, cargo pods cannot drop resources onto Cerys (without researching a specific technology.)
- There are no changes to vanilla content, so it is simple to include Cerys in existing saves.
- Ultimately, Cerys is a set of puzzles and surprises that long-time Factorio players will enjoy.

## Notes

- Rewards to the rest of the game are intentionally modest: venting and flaring towers, plutonium rocket fuel, plutonium portable reactor (made obsolete by Aquilo), plutonium ammo, and an infinite productivity technology.
  - Cerys contains a 2.0 port of GotLag’s [Flare Stack](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Flare%20Stack) of higher quality than we could find. This is planned to be extracted into a separate mod.
- We didn't originally set out to make a full 'planet'. This mod spun out of thesixthroc's explorations in revamping Fulgora for [Space Age: Hardcore Mode](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Space-Age-Hardcore-Mode).
- We enjoy talking to players, so please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VuVhYUBbWE). thesixthroc has an interest in professional game design, feel free to contact him for that.
- If you can't heat anything, take the iron stick out.
